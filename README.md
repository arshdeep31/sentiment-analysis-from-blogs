Maximum countries of the world are considered as the youth or young nation. But unfortunately, these young
ones are the ones suffering the most from emotional distress
and suicide ideation. In India alone, every hour one student
commits suicide and nearly 28 per day. (NRCB). The NCRB
data shows that 10,159 students died by suicide in 2018, an
increase from 9,905 in 2017, and 9,478 in 2016. According to
the survey conducted by CSDS in 2017 between the age group
of 15-34 approximately one out of every four youth moderately
suffered from depression, loneliness, worthlessness, and suicidal
thoughts. 6% of them got suicidal thoughts at least once.
Despite increasing knowledge, most affected young people do
not receive mental health care because the professionals can
not easily identify such groups of people [2]. With most people
expressing their thoughts and emotions on social media whether
positive or negative, examining their posting on the internet
has become an essential part of identifying a person’s emotion.
Manual identification and examining of this data can be very
time-consuming so this paper uses a much better and technical
aspect to solve this problem. A dataset is formed by the collection
of a few individual’s daily blogs and texts and a combination of
machine learning classifiers is used to identify an individual’s
emotion. Then the accuracy of these classifiers is tested and the
best classifier is used in the system to predict people’s emotions.
The result of the analysis shows that the classifier in the system
performs better than the other individual classifiers, professionals
can understand more people’s emotions and see early signs of
emotional distress and provide them with assistance.
